# government-alpha-zero
This project is the pilot of 'Government Alpha Zero' and serves the purpose of transparency in public adminstration globally.

Why "Alpha Zero"? An alpha value of zero defines the opacity as transparent - the name is a play at transparency of and in Government.

As a first use-case, we are developing a set of tools to scrape, clean, and visualise data from public/official/governmental
sources, taking the Province of Chubut in Argentina as an example.

The main scripts and features at this point are:

100% > Master Scraper: getting data from openly accessible sources

working in progress > Master Cleaner: shaping and cleaning the raw data into a master database (csv & sql)


Next steps:

> Master Scrambler: anonymising the master database and creating a shareable master_anon_db (sql)

> Automisation monthly

> Visualisation (Matplotlib, SeabornPlotly/Dash, Shiny)

> Web Publication of first results

> Interactive Web App (Streamlit, Dash)
